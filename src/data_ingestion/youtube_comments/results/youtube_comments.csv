992 and 993 are absolute dream machines someday.
See the writing on the wall brother and sell the egg
"Sell the egg, keep the house, marry Sophia, and have a beautiful life!"
"Or, like so many successful entrepreneurs, keep racking your brain in search of that aha moment!  Mcdonalds and starbucks know your pain well!!"
"Housing market ALWAYS goes up.  Sell K Sig, stay in house 5 more years.  Sell house, rebuild and then lease another with the profits.  I would sell right before office changes again.  Regardless, your house would've increased significantly and the value would stabilize near the top."
1:29 why tf are they hollow?
"Sell everything, cash in. Quit youtube."
"sell the EGG , MARRY SOPHIE seriously dudeüíØ"
992 TURBO S!!!!
Clickbait! Strad = Snitch
Male Karen
"Sells everything and marry Sofia, if you don't you need to get your head checked."
"Sell the egg, keep the house. Add some cool cars to the collection like Hellcat, mustang. Get rid of the high maintenance low fun kinda cars like the Countach"
Get a prenup if you marry Sophia I like her and I'm not saying she is after your money but she doesn't have to be to still get half of it if it doesn't work out
Maybe a gt4rs with forced induction?
buy some eggs and make flan
11:59 üëçüèª
Keep the countach. It‚Äôs the coolest car you have in my opinion.
Does utah sell E85?
Rip egg üòî
Your life is falling apart. Spending money before it‚Äôs in the bank!
‚ÄúFedgrul‚Äù üòÇ unlucky for the mailbox
Buy the turbo S. 991. 100% a better car for the street.
"For my fellow video editors, I coulddddd be wrong  but I think this video was edited on a timeline that is faster than the actual framerate, so the playback is eeeverr so slightly faster lol. I watch stradman so much that something was throwing me off. Nonetheless enjoyed the video"
"Definitely criminal damage to federal property! He needs his cdl taken, how many cars has he done this to? J/s"
Goodbye egg
Strads Pretty Determined to keep the Egg
"Sell Sophie, Keep the house, Marry the egg and then happy days"
Bro is going to regret selling that countach
Call the dot
It is a felony to hit a mailbox.  You should report it.  #LW4WD
992
"992 turbo s!! throw on an exhaust and its perfect, though not as flashy or loud as the gt3rs"
This is a main channel video all the way! Thanks for the content üëç
taking out any mailbox is a federal crime
992 GT3 RS
"everyone, find your own Sophia! don‚Äôt settle for anything less than what these two have"
Egg sell
this channel is falling off because of the koenigsegg
Sell the egg brother
I love how everyone has come to the conclusion the egg gotta go it‚Äôs the smart thing to do
Sell egg Strad
"Fun fact - In Canada people did NOT like these new fangled ""super mailbox"" - especially when they froze solid in freezing rain - uhoh!
I worked a part time job answering after hours calls for Canada Post at the time they started - I got the call from neighbours reporting the damage after a guy rammed his car/truck into a frozen super mailbox at -20C. Tryin to ""fix it""
""i'll escalate this to my supervisor, please stay on the line"" (In French, they were near Quebec City)) 
LOLOLOL
The story made the national news!"
"My uncle races a 1986 911 for PCA and when I go to the races and see all the different eras of 911‚Äôs, Its interesting hearing the one in this vid bc its so familiar and then I think of how everyone has experience with different cars and now they‚Äôre so used to it that hearing them isn‚Äôt the same as the first time"
Sell the egg life is good
Please just sell the dang Koenigsegg already and keep the house.

Smart investors know the alt run is where fortunes are made. Alemio Network ICO is the key to capitalizing on it!
"Not financial advice, but Alemio Network is looking like one of the more legit projects I‚Äôve seen in a while. Definitely worth checking out."
Alemio token + a Trump crypto pump = a recipe for massive gains. Don‚Äôt miss out!
The Alemio Network presale bonuses got me thinking about a long-term investment strategy. Time to dig deeper!
"BTC will go over 200k in the next year or two, that is approx 3x. Alemio can do 100x if you get positioned well. Just check it out"
"Ethereum will outperform Bitcoin in the following year, Alemio Network will outperform them both by far."
"If I need to choose top 3 AI coins, my picks are FET, INJ and ALM (Alemio Network), not in that particular order"
Anyone else noticing how quiet Alemio Network is flying under the radar? This is usually how the big gains sneak up on you!
"As someone who believes in the power of crypto, Alemio Network's presale has caught my attention."
"I like your picks, but these coins are already long in the market. I only invest into presales or private sales to get the best position. Alemio Network has one now, and now is the time to ape in, not one or more years later."
The ALM presale is selling fast for a reason. People are really seeing the value in this project. Can‚Äôt wait to see what‚Äôs next for Alemio Network.
Top tier presale just begun. I think Alemio Network is one of the most promissing projects year to date.
The potential of Alemio Network's AI-driven investments is worth exploring. Presale entry point
"Alemio Network is one of the rare moonshot projects out there, must check!"
"Just jumped into the Alemio token ICO. If you're serious about DeFi, this is your chance to get in early before the masses catch on."
"Presales and ICOs are the best thing in crypto, if you manage to ape in. Alemio Network is one of the prospects out there, easy 50x very soon."
I think Alemio token ALM will be one of the top performers in bullrun 2024/2025.
"The roadmap for Alemio is super ambitious. If they can deliver on even half of it, we‚Äôre in for a massive ride. ALM to the moon?"
What if I told you that Alemio Network will crush most of the top tier AI coins by the end of the year?
Rumor is that Michael Saylor invested in Alemio Network and will push this project to the moon!
"This is one-in-a-bull-run opportunity, you don¬¥t wanna miss Alemio Network presale"
Eagerly awaiting the impact of Alemio on the crypto market. The presale is just the beginning of what promises to be a groundbreaking journey
Stradman will you please sell me your backpack üòä
"11:52 ""Thats BAD"" üëèsophie says as she eats her chikfila mac n cheese"

"If Sophia doesn't want to live in Utah and in that house, sell it and move to AZ and you guys get married. Then in 1-2 years build or remodel a new house down there that will be her dream house. She should be 10x more important than any car or pile of wood and bricks."

"he should show Oskar more than Sophie in the videos. I was fine with her when she was in the twin turbo gallardo video as a paid actor, but now its just getting old. and to all the people saying ""marry sophia"", ""merry sophia"" etc. I dont think its in her employment contract to get married to James. it was weird to me at first that she had to keep going back and forth to canada. but then i realized its cause her husband is there, along with her 3 children, and home renovation business."
Might be time for a home update by removing all cement and reinstalled with infloor heating to stop ice/snow buildup

Also i want to see your fathers truck finished! Im From Mass and love the video you made!"
"The latch in the door of the Aventador is probably stuck in the open position, as if you're pulling the handle. If it's not broken it may just need lubrication. As far as the mailbox goes those pieces are not bolts. Those pieces go down in the hole and the bolt screws down into them. They have threading on the inside and they also expand to hold everything in place"
"Go 991.2 turbo s no question, 991.2 has analog gauges 992 doesn‚Äôt. My dad had a 991.2 turbo S and it‚Äôs insane! You need"

"Sell the agera HH for a CCX being the ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù option, keep the house and finish up areas that need to be finished, marry Sophia, and maybe get a car alongside the CCX?"
My name in the title
"Sell the agera HH and get a ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù hypercar being a Koenigsegg CCX  that way you can mod it in terms of putting an aftermarket exhaust on it and other stuff like that plus selling the agera HH for a CCX would free up cash to finish your house up in areas that need it and you‚Äôd still be a part of the ghost squadron. Also I‚Äôm pretty sure the CCX has a manual option as well so that would be cool having a manual Koenigsegg on the channel, and by ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù I mean the CCX is $1.2 mil compared to the $3.5mil price tag of the agera HH."

Strad is trying to cover his mistake by blaming the truck. üòÇ. He was probably driving it to see what being a trucker was like.
"strad..........please for the love of god just sell the egg

"Dang, makes me think twice about moving to Utah! I'll give you $250k and the dog goes with it."
A big block would be an awesome choice for your dads pickup. Imagine saying your dads pickup has a 10L motor. Make for great headlines and would be a unique choice compated to all the LS builds on youtube.

"Absolutely sell the Egg. This house has been so long in the making, and it‚Äôs literally-in your words-your DREAM HOUSE. It seems silly to rid yourself of something you‚Äôve poured so much heart and soul into only to keep one of 13 or so cars‚Ä¶
The car represents a joyful experience; the house, on the other hand-and even the girl, if that‚Äôs where you decide to take things-represents a life.
Think about it, man. We love you."
"That‚Äôs truck drivers info will not be hard find drive around look for the house with a bunch new pallets of stuff if anyone‚Äôs there asking if they havve the info of who delivered it

Clickbait title again
The egg is a milestone. The bug was a milestone. You've made it dude. We all respect it. We'd all respect you selling it. For the channel there's not much you can do with it. Modify it and it loses value. Take more trips and get back to the shenanigans. Like skis and tracks on aventadors...
Sell the egg keep house and girl. Build an overland vehicle
"Your video always put a smile on my face even though i'm facing a really hard time now, i just got bankrupt, become homeless with no money what so ever and recently got left by my wife, but watching your video wether on your main channel or this one has always put me in Cheer.
Been watching your video since 2016, love to meet you someday when i already get back on my feet, love from your biggest fan in indonesia üòä"
"Strad saying he can't show us the footage because he's going to the airport. Ever hear about editing buddy? Obviously joking around, Strad is one of the best around, even if this video could be considered slight clickbait for audience adrenaline rush."

So strad needs a flamethrower
"Dude, even if you aren't likely to see this. It isn't worth reporting that truck driver for the damaging the property, because if they admitted to it then they wouldn't be sentenced to prison, but because they drove off they would likely be facing maybe 3-5 years plus a large fine. The dude was likely tired and just doing his job, it isn't going to affect you, you'll still get your 15% off coupons that you won't use in the mail."
"Sell the egg, get a pool done before summer"
Sell the egg
"I work for the USPS and deal directly with mailboxes getting destroyed.  Your box is defently owned and maintained by the post office.  Your letter carrier will alert management to the downed mailbox.  A couple of maintenance workers will come and secure the box back in the concrete.  The post office will not try to investigate who hit the box.  Frankly, it's not worth the time and effort."
Did the HOA pay for the roads or have the roads been turned over to the county. It is always better to push for the county to take over roads
I‚Äôm just starting the video please don‚Äôt tell me they hit the countach

"If you're selling the egg, please keep the Countach. We need a ""Lamborghini Collector Stradman""."
Sell the egg
"I think you should keep the countach for its future value. The car is very desired especially with that spec. Not only that, but now that the new countach is out, collectors are going to be wanting them more and more which means the price goes way up."
Those are not bolts. They are concrete anchors.

"If you sell the house, you will always wonder what it could have been. We are fans of cars of all types, not having a hyper car doesn‚Äôt make any of your og fans not want to watch. I think sell whatever cars you need to finish the house, and then see if you still want to sell it! If you do, you will have a surplus of money to reinvest in your collection however you‚Äôd like. But the people want the Batmobile(Aventador) in the bat cave! At least finish the house and then sell it so you can see what the house can be when it‚Äôs finished"
"Hey strad, i think you should travel tge world doing car content"
The egg isn‚Äôt all that anymore. You have everything you‚Äôve wanted and you have Sophia. Put that ring on her finger and just live life with her for a while and no more hyper. Least not yet‚Ä¶.

"IF you get a gt3rs, get the 991.2. The 992 is too bubbly and lacks aggressive angles other than the rear (due to the wing). The 991.2 on the other hand is aggressive all round and a great car to modify IF you don't want to keep it stock."

"Do NOT sell the Egg, if you think about investment wise, now the Murcielago is gone too, it‚Äôs the only investment worthy car in your collection, if you sell it now you won‚Äôt be able to get another one for that price again because of how the demand is going up for the Ageras. However it‚Äôs your car and your decision at the end of the day so if you sell it, imo you should get an another investment worthy car maybe a CGT or even a Huayra, considering the fact that Koenigseggs known for their unreliability, those options would be a lot better."
Did you pay less for the Lambo?
"keep the countach and the espada, sell the egg and keep the house"

I WOULD RATHER HAVE THE GT3 RS THAN THE CADDY

"Bro, do not feel pressured by your fans to sell the koenigsegg, do whatever you think is the best for the channel or your bankaccount... But please do something again. buy something new, sell old cars. You need content to grow."
The USPIS is the federal law enforcement arm of the United States Postal Service. It is basically the FBI for mail crimes.
"Yeah, sounds like it‚Äôs time to move"
7:21 Finally
Looking forward to seeing who gets what for Christmas!

"Everybody body saying sell this, sell that. You don't think he knows this? Crying out loud, he use to be an accountant. Unless he knows he spending too much and can't afford it."
Sell the egg.
"nobody cares about the egg, its stupid to sell the house over a car"
Please tell me you filed a police report on the mailbox?
"I love the day to day video -- For what it's worth, just so you know, those are inserts start out in two pieces. Drill into the concrete, pop the inserts in which are soft, lead-like material, and then pop in the bolts. #TheMoreYouKnow üåà‚≠ê"
i'm from the LA region. that smog is nothing. we get bad enough smog days that we can't even see the mountain.
Sell the EGG
please dont sell the egg its just too sick!!
That something happened to our same model of mailbox at the airport lol. The base is too small for the weight sometimes they even break in high winds. We created a custom bottom support to fix the issue.
The clickbait is crazy but it‚Äôs part of the game and your the best at it. Always watch the vids when I see them pop up
I hate clickbait videos where the thumbnail and title make it sound like someone hit your Countach.

That truck driver was having a day off ahah
Sell the EGG!!! Buy lots of fun ‚Äúcheap cars‚Äù and FINISH THE HOUSE!!!
I drove a semi and have for the last 14 yrs. Yes it is a federal crime for the mail box and its destruction of city property in a commercial vehicle so that makes it a federal hit and run along with destruction of private property for running over the grass/ dirt areas. Not to mention leaving the scene of multiple crimes. Basicly if you can get the name of the company on the side of the truck they are screwed. Every truck has gps
Those were not BOLTS.....
"They're very few police departments you don't wanna mess with. The United States Postal Inspectors are one of them. You mess with the mail, they will come down on you like the IRS. It is a federal crime to hit and run a mailbox as it is federal property. The stop sign is also state property."
Not that is matters but what you said were split bolts were the inserts that were used for the bolts to mount into the concrete and really those should have been deeper.
Sell the egg bro. It's not worth it
Jay Leno is looking for an Espada!

"If you go for a GT3 RS, please go for a 997, it would make me soo happy"

Those aren‚Äôt bolts. They are lag shield lead anchors. They are meant to be split. When I bolt is driven into it they spread to hold in concrete. But what a douche. How is he just gonna drive away. also good click bait. I thought your car was hit.

Tu fais du tri chez toi pour ensuite acheter des produits mal not√©s au risque de pas les utiliser je comprends pas üò≠
"Super vid√©o tu dois en refaire avec d‚Äôautres marques ! ‚ù§ par contre la prochaine fois tu pourrais juste regarder la note, commencer le makeup en donnant ton avis √† chaud et ensuite lire les avis ? Comme √ßa tu seras pas influenc√© par les commentaires des gens ;)"
"Coucou Andie, quel bronzer taupe recommandes-tu pour les peaux claires? üòçü´∂üèª"
"C‚Äôest vraiment les best vid√©os. Genre crash test marque, maquillage, nourriture c‚Äôest la base üëå"
"25min de pur bonheur, Andie je pourrais regarder tes videos pendant des heures et des heures"
Est que tu pourrais faire une vid√©o sur ta routine capillaire?√ßa m‚Äôint√©resse !tu as de supers beaux cheveux !
J‚Äôadore tes vid√©os je te suit depuis un moment d√©j√† merci pour ton contenu et ta marque incroyable ! Pourrait tu dans une de tes vid√©os nous montrer tout tes talons ? üòä
Pour ranger l'eyeliner il faut le ranger un pot √† crayon avec les pinceaux....

Merci Andie üíò J‚Äôai go√ªt√©e ton matcha √† la vanille et franchement il est trop bonnnn
"J'en suis au moment o√π tu appliques l'anti cernes, peut-√™tre que les pailettes se voient plus ou moins selon la lumi√®re qui tape dessus et/ou la poudre ! Parce que j'ai ce soucis avec l'anti-cernes Backstage de chez Dior (en plus Dior donc il co√ªte la peau du cul cimer), je me suis rendue compte que les ""nacres"" contenuent dans le produit ressortent une fois la poudre appliqu√©e, et elles se voient de ouf √† la lumi√®re artificielle ü•≤"
Coucou Andiie je sais pas si tu vas voir ce commentaire mais √ßa serai dr√¥le que tu fasses une vid√©o o√π tu maquilles ton mec et inversement fait que avec tes produits pref qu'on trouve chez sephora
J‚Äôadore tes revues makeup. Tu n‚Äôoublies jamais de nous dire que  nous sommes chacun diff√©rent et avec des attentes diff√©rentes. Ce n‚Äôest pas toujours que le produit n‚Äôest pas bon. ‚ù§
"J'ai ador√© cette vid√©o tr√®s int√©ressante, j'ai le micro filling pen de chez Benefit ( le feutre )et je l'aime beaucoup car il discipline et comble les trous et fonce aussi la teinte naturelle, voil√† c'est le myst√®re du maquillage on est parfois seule ( j'exag√®re) √† aimer un produit ! √Ä bient√¥t Andie"
Une vid√©o sur tes dupes serait sympas :)
Le olehendryksen je l'ai test√©e est vraiment je d√©teste il colle vraiment beaucoup c'est un gloss certes mais compar√© au fenty la diff√©rence est folle mais le olehendryksen il fait un effet bizzare sur la l√®vres c'est horrible je me suis faite influencer je regrette mon achat.... Mais super vid√©o

"Je comprends largement les avis pour la palette de 4 fards Charlotte Tillbury. C'est extr√™mement cher et franchement, les fards sont quasi invisibles, pas du tout pigment√©s. Quand t'as appliqu√© le fard √† paillettes, il n'y a aucune pigmentation, seulement quelques paillettes transparentes mais absolument pas de la teinte dans la palette. Quand t'es un peu plus √©loign√©e de la cam√©ra, on ne voit plus rien. Payer aussi cher 4 fards non pigment√©s, je ne vois pas en quoi c'est un bon produit... 
Pareil pour le crayon √† sourcils, y a rien qui va : la teinte est orange, on voit strictement rien il y a aucune diff√©rence entre ton avant apr√®s. 
Bref, merci pour cette vid√©o, au moins on sait qu'on peut se fier aux avis Sephora sur les produits √† ne pas acheter üòÖ"

"For 150‚Ç¨, is it ok ?"
Bro been hitting the GSYM
"Do not buy note 13.

I am loyal to Xiaomi Redmi phones. However, my new Redmi Note 13 disappoints me a lot. 

My Redmi note 8 performs much better than my newly bought Redmi note 13.

1. Camera - I already accepted the fact that the note 13 doesn't have stabilization capability during video recording. However, taking photos with note 13 is horrible. Note 8 is much better. Note 13 blurs a lot, it hardly focuses on the subject even I touched the screen. And noise is noticeable too.

2. It lags a lot. It is noticeable when scrolling. 60, 120... Both lags a lot. It lags when opening apps too.

3. Thumbnails load slowly or doesn't even load.

While I am composing this, I am asking opinion from my family member who has the same phone. He is also experiencing the same problems. We both came up into a conclusion that instead of having an upgrade, it is definitely a downgrade from buying note 13."
Hm?
"Oppo a 60 or mi note 13.
Which one would be better for me?
Could anyone enlighten please"

I'd get it if it had better speakers
the front camera video at 1080 for even the latest redmi note 14 is still at 1080 30fps which is super choppy impossible to use when everyone is on tiktok or insta.  no stereo speakers.  but am glad fingerprint sensor still side mounted because i saw many samsung phones spoil with fingerprint sensor on display and repair people been telling me side mount is way better.  dont understand why xiaomi just keeps recycling the same nonsense with its camera.. and standard storage for budget models never gets to 512.

"Just ordered this in Arctic White for 179‚Ç¨, great deal imo! It's rare to find a decent phone with SD card slot and headphone jack nowadays, so that's really nice. Time to replace my Redmi 9T which I had for almost 4 years."
Why battery prblm is faced in this phone ?

"Wish they also had a smaller version, a Mini of this ph, say about 6"" display"
Are able to do contactless payment?
"Just bought this for a week on a small discount. 

+ AMOLED+gorilla glass
+ Dolby Atmos
+ Hyper os android 14
+ Good camera
- easy to heat up
- lame UI 
- slow speaker 
- side finger print


It's good and smooth experience since supported hyper os after update. Decent 108mp camera on daylight and proper lightings. 

Slower speaker compare other competitors but support Dolby Atmos. 

Nice AMOLED screen with gorilla glass, small bezels. But not good enough for bright daylight outdoor display. 

Good chipset with 5g support. Easy to overheat not suggested for mainly outdoor uses. Capable for games I tried on codm and modern warship. 

All other variant had stereo speaker and in display fingerprint reader. But not this note 13 5g model. This one just differ than other sibling variants.

Good in hand feels and light. 

If you had more budget better go for pro version with sd 7s gen3. 

Honestly I think I regret and should get realme 12 5g instead but realme got no promotion that time. 

Realme 12 5g had better UI, camera(slight better), stereo speaker, premium like design, better os+security updates and build quality. But no AMOLED display.

Still, it's good phone. Can't argue with the price since inflation getting worse."
Genuine question. Would you guys recommend this for very cassual gaming? A play codm and ml sometimes but not so much since i got school and i take care of our store

this device or the A25 5G? I'm worried about the Xiaomi software since it may have many bugs"
pick another tune for test like all videos has same song
How much is this
"Crazy that people in the states will pay double for this phone while it barely has cellular coverage. Goes to show, people really want phones like this here. Sucks we don't get them"
Bro been working out
so the 4G version is better ?
Why they give android 13 with this? I mean wtf
"Just bought this redmi note 13 5G for my mum, the 1080p video shooting for real camera and front camera with EIS stabilization with auto on mode."
The perfect smartphone
"Has 100 MP camera, can't record in 4K. üëÄ"
"Movies look rly nice on this one. The AMOLED display is gorgeous.
It has even a micro sd tray, which i upgraded to 1TB.
Watching YT or movies makes lot of fun. 
Here in germany the price is dropped from 280 euro to 220 euro...
for this price, redmi 13 5g is unbeatable."
"Shoppers beware - the 4G version of the Redmi Note 13 phone uses the Snapdragon 685 (6nm), and NOT the MediaTek Dimensity 6080 of this 5G version. Their benchmarks are wildly different, but GSM Arena doesn't have a separate listing for the 4G & 5G variants, which is frustrating, because if they only list the better specs, you could easily be disappointed if you eventually buy the cheaper model."
Omg...why are GSM Arena videos so late reviewing products? The phones have been out 2 months before they review! Rubbish!
"Im liking the screen design being more rectangular, hopefully xiaomi will continue this on all their line up next year."
Please make a video on Meizu 21 pro black colour
Why is your website down from last 10 hours
Why my phone lagging very strong.... whyyy?
"Youre website not working again , is u get hacked again by india ?"
Please do a review on iqoo neo 9 pro
"I'm very happy with this phone because it's rare for a new phone to have both 3.5mm jack and an SD card slot. I very much dislike wireless earbuds and using cloud services. The phone might not be perfect but it's the best one for my needs that I could find now. I love the panorama photos. Even when there are many people walking while I take a panorama photo, it doesn't make them look weird. I'm very happy with it and I can't wait to try the HyperOS soon."
12 Pro+ 5G is still better specs wise.
When will be the Phone Buying Guide updated again ?
"This note 13 series discrimination, mono speaker, the other stereo speaker, why xiaomi?..."
Price kya hai
Good
4k video note support
"Very nice colour and build, but inside nah"
"I feel like they're much lower in quality then they used to be, the note series that is"
this or the now cheaper poco x5
"Received my Note 13 5G in Arctic white yesterday. It suits me fine cause I'm not a gamer or possessed by numbers and the highest level of processor. Using it for daily use as social media, email and watching movies. So far its awesome for my use. Just waiting for the new OS upgrade."
"4:50 It is advertised as having 3x 'lossless' zoom, so that could explain why the 3x shots are better than the 2x ones, as they didn't specify the 2x mode as being lossless."
How does the GPS work? On previous redmi was pretty useless.
Gsmarena is the BEST
Looking forward to your Nothing Phone (2a) review. I think that is the phone to get this year.
"Oooh a review...
Just bought this phone for my mum"
I'd never ever consider this without dual speakers.
Waarom zitten jullie Chinese Spyware aan te prijzen??? üòë
Review Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G.
"Nice Phone, Thank you to review"
10-bit color model. Note series is getting really stupid. How many models are out there? 10-15?
Can you guys re-review Realme C55 after the android 14 update?
Having an OLED with high refresh rate at this price point is just so tempting. This itself and the not bad chipset and camera is just unbeatable. Nice one!
"üëçüèΩ
97"
"Poco m6 pro is better, lighter, lacks 5g but who cares, better cameras and stereo speakers."
Poco X6 or Moto Edge 40 Neo are better choices
The redmi note 13 series is not good
Poco x6 base variant id better
His voice is very soothing
